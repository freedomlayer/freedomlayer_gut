Hi. Welcome to the **Freedomlayer** project website.  We work here on designing a
scalable, secure and distributed mesh network. We put strong
emphasis on the theoretic side of things, researching scalable algorithms for
secure routing in a flat network. At the same time we strive to implement a
practical real world solution.

We are still in research stages. These days we mostly try to understand how to
route a message securly through a mesh network. We have some good ideas, but we
still have to refine them before we have something that can really work.  Our
main ideas are documented at the [research
section](research.mdown).
